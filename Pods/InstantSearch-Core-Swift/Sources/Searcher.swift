// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
// # Sequencing logic
//
// An important part of the `Searcher` is to manage the proper sequencing
// of search requests and responses.
//
// Conceptually, a search session can be seen as a sequence of *queries*,
// each query resulting in one or more *requests* to the API (one per page).
// Each request is assigned an auto-incremented sequence number.
//
// Example:
//
// ```
// Queries:    A --> B --> C --> D
//             |     |     |     |
// Requests:   1     2     4     6
//             â€¦     |     |
//            (X)    3     5
// ```
//
// Now, there are important rules to guarantee a consistent behavior:
//
// 1. A `loadMore()` request for a query will be ignored if a more recent
//    query has already been requested.
//
//    For example, in the diagram above: request X (page 2 of query A) will
//    be ignored if request 2 (page 1 of query B) has already been sent.
//
// 2. Results for a request will be ignored if results have already been
//    received for a more recent request.
//
//    For example, in the diagram above: results for request 3 will be
//    ignored if results have already been received for request 4.
//

///
/// The purpose of this class is to maintain a state between searches and handle pagination.
///
/// ### Handling results
///
/// There are three ways to handle responses to search requests issued by a `Searcher`. From the highest level to the
/// lowest level, they are:
///
/// 1. Register a **result handler** block. It will be called each time a response is received, providing either the
///    results (in case of success) or the error (in case of failure). You may register as many result handlers as
///    necessary.
///
/// 2. Register a **delegate**. It provides additional information, such as the `Searcher` instance that received the
///    response, and the search parameters that were used for the request. You may register at most one delegate.
///
/// 3. Listen for **notifications** issued by this searcher (using `NotificationCenter`). Notifications give you
///    extra information, such as request sequence numbers, or whether requests are cancelled by the searcher.
///
